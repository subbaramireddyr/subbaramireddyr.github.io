        <h2>Meet Subbaramireddy,</h2>
        <p>
            I am a passionate bioinformatics professional dedicated to unravelling the complexities of biological data through computational methods. With a strong educational foundation and practical experience in both bioinformatics and biotechnology, I strive to make meaningful contributions to the field of biomedical research.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I graduated with a Master of Science in Bioinformatics, specializing in Omics at <a href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/bioinformatics/" target="_blank">Northeastern University</a>, where I have delved into computational methods, genomics, and statistical analysis. My academic journey also includes Integrated Biotechnology from <a href="https://vit.ac.in/schools/sbst" target="_blank">Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT)</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Niche and Expertise</h3>
        <p>
            My expertise lies in leveraging computational methods to analyze complex biological data, with a focus on whole genome sequencing(WGS), RNA-seq data analysis, and genetic variant identification. I am particularly interested in exploring the genomic underpinnings of complex diseases and developing personalized medicine strategies. Through my research, I aim to enhance our understanding of the interplay between genetics and therapeutic outcomes, ultimately contributing to advancements in precision healthcare.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Professional Journey</h3>
        <p>
        At <a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/research" target="_blank">Brigham and Women's Hospital</a>, I am currently a Bioinformatics Research Analyst (Jan 2025 â€“ Present), where I lead efforts to profile immune cell populations and analyze transcriptional changes across biological conditions using single-cell RNA sequencing of PBMCs. My work supports the identification of key immune cell shifts and gene expression signatures that inform broader biological hypotheses related to treatment response.Previously, as a Research Analyst I Coop (Jan 2024 - Dec 2024), I analyzed whole Genome Sequencing data to study the impact of genetic mimics of GLP1-Ra and SGLT2i therapy on cardio-kidney outcomes. I focused on applying advanced statistical approaches and developing genetic scores to simulate lifelong therapeutic effects.
        <p>
        Earlier, I worked as a Computational Biology Intern at Carpenter Lab, Indiana University, Where I conducted integrative RNA-seq data analysis for breast cancer research. This experience honed my skills in RNA-seq data preprocessing, differential expression analysis, and pathway analysis.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Beyond Bioinformatics</h3>
        <p>
            Outside of my professional life, I have a deep love for nature and enjoy exploring the great outdoors through hiking and trekking. Travelling is a significant part of my life, as I love discovering new places and immersing myself in different cultures. Along with this, I have a particular fondness for trying out new food and visiting local coffee shops wherever I go. Exploring diverse cuisines and experiencing the unique atmospheres of coffee shops around the world adds to my enjoyment and appreciation of different cultures.
        </p>
