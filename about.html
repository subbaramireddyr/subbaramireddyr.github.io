        <h2>Meet Subbaramireddy,</h2>
        <p>
            I am a passionate bioinformatics professional dedicated to unraveling the complexities of biological data through computational methods. With a strong educational foundation and practical experience in both bioinformatics and biotechnology, I strive to make meaningful contributions to the field of biomedical research.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Bioinformatics with an Omics concentration at <a href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/bioinformatics/" target="_blank">Northeastern University</a> , where I have delved into computational methods, genomics, and statistical analysis. My academic journey also includes Integrated Biotechnology from <a href="https://vit.ac.in/schools/sbst" target="_blank">Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT)</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Niche and Expertise</h3>
        <p>
            My expertise lies in integrating computational tools with biological data to uncover insights that drive research forward. I have a particular interest in genome assembly, differential gene expression analysis, and pathway enrichment analysis. Through my work, I aim to contribute to the understanding of complex diseases and the development of precision medicine strategies.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Professional Journey</h3>
        <p>
        At <a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/research" target="_blank">Brigham and Women's Hospital</a>, I work as a Research Analyst I Coop, focusing on analyzing whole exome sequencing data to study the impact of genetic mimics of GLP1-Ra and SGLT2i therapy on cardio-kidney outcomes. My role involves using advanced statistical techniques and developing genetic scores to simulate lifelong treatment effects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Previously, as a Computational Biology Intern at Carpenter Lab, Indiana University, I conducted integrative RNA-seq data analysis for breast cancer research. This experience honed my skills in RNA-seq data preprocessing, differential expression analysis, and pathway analysis.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Beyond Bioinformatics</h3>
        <p>
            Outside of my professional life, I have a deep love for nature and enjoy exploring the great outdoors through hiking and trekking. Traveling is a significant part of my life, as I love discovering new places and immersing myself in different cultures. Along with this, I have a particular fondness for trying out new food and visiting local coffee shops wherever I go. Exploring diverse cuisines and experiencing the unique atmospheres of coffee shops around the world adds to my enjoyment and appreciation of different cultures.
        </p>
